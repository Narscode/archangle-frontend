# Archangle Frontend Project

This is mockup project for archangle idea that linked to the [hardhat-smartcontract](https://github.com/NLX-OTI-archangle/hardhat-smartcontract.git) and  [ai-service](https://github.com/NLX-OTI-archangle/hardhat-smartcontract.git) Repositories. 

This Project includes :
- hydra guard
- sentinel 
- cerberus
- vanguard
- investigasi aktif `[active investigation]`
- pelaporan aktif `[reporting and evidence]`

you can play role based model here as the admin and the user.

- **`user`** : you can simulate doing fraud transactions.
- **`admin`** : as the user do fraud and any other anomaly transaction you (admin) can detect and tract that transactions.

## Setup
### .env [development]
To start the project you need to set the `.env`:
```bash
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x5F....

NEXTAUTH_SECRET=HAmO....
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...-.....apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=....-...-...
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

In [hardhat-smartcontract](https://github.com/NLX-OTI-archangle/hardhat-smartcontract.git) you need to run **(to activate the solana environtment locally)** `[keep it on]`
```bash
npx hardhat node 
```

The result should be like this
```bash
Started HTTP and WebSocket JSON-RPC server at http://127.0.0.1:8545/
